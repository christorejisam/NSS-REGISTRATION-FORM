# NSS-REGISTRATION-FORM

**✨Introduction**

In this project I develop the Basic Demo - NSS management system for our college. 
The National Service Scheme (NSS) is an Indian government-sponsored public 
service program conducted by the Department of Youth Affairs and Sports of 
the Government of India. Popularly known as NSS, the scheme was launched 
in Gandhiji’s Centenary year, 1969. Aimed at developing student’s personality through 
community service, NSS is a voluntary association of young people in Colleges, Universities 
and at +2 level working for a campus-community linkage.

**⭐️EXISTING SYSTEM:**

- Conventional method of adding new Volunteers Enrolment is only paper based and 
manual operations only to be done.
- If the Volunteers details are more, then searching the volunteers from the list is 
done manually, which is time taking and also not able to identify easily too.
- Search process of the volunteers usually is manual in the existing systems.
- In the existing system, the reports cannot be done, as all the process are paper 
works only.

**DISADVANTAGES OF EXISTING SYSTEM❗️**

- More time taking process
- More hectic process too, if the number of volunteers is more.

**⭐️PROPOSED SYSTEM:**

- In the proposed system, I intend to develop a web-based application providing the 
necessary services and online enrolment of the Volunteers
- Adding new volunteers made automation reduces the paper works and also makes 
attractive for new volunteers to join easily, as the process became very small.
- The enrolled volunteers can be easily searching with the basic features of new 
updates in his /her portal etc.

**💖ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:**

- User friendliness is provided in the application with various controls.
- The system makes the overall project management much easier and flexible.
- Readily uploads the latest updates and allows users to interact.
- It provides a high level of security with different levels of authentication.
